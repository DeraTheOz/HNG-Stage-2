# TicketFlow: Streamlined Ticket Management

## Overview

TicketFlow is a modern, responsive single-page application built with Vue.js for efficient ticket creation, tracking, and management. It leverages Pinia for robust state management, Vue Router for seamless navigation, and Tailwind CSS for a sleek, utility-first design, providing a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
- **Ticket Creation**: Easily create new tickets with titles, descriptions, and initial status.
- **Ticket Management**: View, edit, and delete existing tickets.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: A personalized dashboard displaying a summary of all tickets, categorized by status (Open, In Progress, Closed).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Client-Side Persistence**: User and ticket data are persisted locally using `localStorage`.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all forms to enhance user input quality.
